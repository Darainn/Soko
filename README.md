<h1>Soko</h1>
<p>
Soko is an app that attempts to make the ability to connect to an online audience, especially as a small business owner open source. With that said, our app provide small scale retailers with the added facet of creating an online shop, adding their product catalogue, and advertising to a wider online audience. No matter the industry they are in. Our aim is to eliminate brick and motor costs by providing sellers with the ability to sell from anywhere, anytime, and to connect buyers to retailers around them, ulimately raising consumer satisfaction, by enhancing service delivery through solving issues such as last mile delivery and customer experience.

We have also attemted to add a social media feel to the app, by creating a functionality whereby small scale retailers are able to connect to other businesses around them, thereby increasing chances of b2b communication. Their customers can also connect to their shops and receive constant updates on new products. We wish to continue building upon this foundation, because we feel that small scale retailers are the ones who have been left out by innovation and technology. Small scale retailers also deserve an ability to network, and connect with their core customers. How many young and motivated individuals sell DIY products from the comfort of their own bedrooms, how many corporate professionals have thrifting side hustles? What if we can connect this motivated group of individuals and make the process of doing business as seamless as possible?

The app is built using laravel for the backend and Vue.js, html, css and bootstrap for the frontend.
